Overview: Transform your Project 1 function library into an object-oriented system by designing and implementing 4-6 core classes for your Information Science domain. This project demonstrates how OOP combines related data and behavior into cohesive, reusable objects.
Key Goal: Create well-designed classes with proper encapsulation, validation, and documentation that integrate your Project 1 functions and prepare for inheritance in Project 3.

Brainstorming: Here are classes that could be used:

1. InventoryItem

Purpose: Represents a single inventory item with batches.

Integrates Functions: generate_unique_id, reduce_stock_on_sale, compute_available_quantity, alert_expiring_items

Attributes: _item_id, _name, _unit, _threshold, _batches

Methods:

add_batch(quantity, expiration=None) → add a batch (maps to add_batch)

compute_available_quantity(include_expired=False) → total stock

reduce_stock(quantity, use_fifo=True) → reduce stock on sale

alert_expiring_items(days_threshold=3) → near-expiry batches

__str__ / __repr__
