Project title and description:
Universal Restaurant Inventory Management System — a small, extensible Python library of functions to manage perishable and non-perishable supplies for restaurants. The library tracks batches, supports FIFO consumption, expiration alerts, waste reporting, and restock planning.

Team members and roles:

Canon Teselle — OOP & Integration

Benjamin Jahries — Function Library & Data 

Saad Alkinani — Testing & Reports 

For the function libraray all team members must implement 3-5 functions and contribute to this README


Main Project focus: Helps restaurants avoid stockouts, reduce food waste, and plan restocking by tracking per-batch inventory and predicting demand during peak periods.


Here is a list of functions that will be implememted by each person, 15 total functions: 

Ben (Function Library & Data) — implement:
add_new_item, add_batch, format_inventory_snapshot, export_inventory_csv, calculate_file_checksum

Canon (OOP & Integration) — implement:
generate_unique_id, reduce_stock_on_sale, compute_available_quantity, alert_expiring_items, generate_restock_plan 

Saad (Testing & Reports) — implement:
record_usage_pattern, generate_waste_report, mark_expired_items, calculate_reorder_list, forecast_demand
